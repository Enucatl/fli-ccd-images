Compile
----------
just type:

make


if the compiler cannot find the proper headers and libraries, you are
    probably missing these variables (ready to copy & paste on a bash shell):

#setup ROOT from afs/cern.ch
source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/gcc/4.6/x86_64-slc6-gcc46-opt/setup.sh
source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/app/releases/ROOT/5.34.03/x86_64-slc6-gcc46-opt/root/bin/thisroot.sh
alias root='root -l'
#setup boost c++ libraries
#change the following line if needed
#so that it points to your installation of Boost
export BOOST_HOME=/home/specuser/boost_install
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$(BOOST_HOME)/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(BOOST_HOME)/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=$(BOOST_HOME)/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH


Run
----------------------
run the programme by supplying a FILE or FOLDER name on the command line

./bin/ccdfli_viewer FILE/FOLDER

if you specify a FOLDER name, it will continuously update the display with
    the most recent image in the folder.


Python 
----------------------
reads all images in a folder and convert them from RAW to PNG
also saves a gif animation with all the png images

python python/make_gif.py FOLDER
