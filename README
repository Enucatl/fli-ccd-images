suite of classes and programmes that read the raw images taken by the CCD
FLI camera in OFLG/U210

requirements:
The BOOST c++ libraries > 1.52
http://www.boost.org

The ROOT data analysis framework > 5.34
http://root.cern.ch




Compile
----------

make


if the compiler cannot find the proper headers and libraries, you are
    probably missing these variables (ready to copy&paste on a bash shell):

#setup ROOT from afs/cern.ch
source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/gcc/4.6/x86_64-slc6-gcc46-opt/setup.sh
source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/app/releases/ROOT/5.34.03/x86_64-slc6-gcc46-opt/root/bin/thisroot.sh
alias root='root -l'
#setup boost c++ libraries
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/specuser/boost_install/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/specuser/boost_install/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=/home/specuser/boost_install/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH


Standalone programmes
----------------------

for reading a specific image:
    ./single_image_reader

watch a folder for new images:
    ./online_viewer

run them to get help
