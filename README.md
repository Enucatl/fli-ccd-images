ccdfli viewer
==========

ROOT GUI programme to view the files recorded by the CCD
FLI camera in OFLG/U210.

version tags >= v2.00 mark the development of the newer (but less stable) GUI app.
If you want the stable versions stick with v1.XX.

To back up to e.g. v1.23 just type:
`git checkout v1.23`


Requirements
----------

GCC >= 4.3 (for copy semantics used with boost::thread)

GNU make >= 3.80 (for order-only prerequisites with '|' in this Makefile)

The BOOST c++ libraries >= 1.50
http://www.boost.org

The ROOT data analysis framework >= 5.34
http://root.cern.ch


Report Bugs & Request Features
----------
please report any bugs or feature request using the [issues webpage](https://bitbucket.org/Enucatl/readimages/issues/new).


Compile
----------
just type:

`make`


if the compiler cannot find the proper headers and libraries, you are
    probably missing these variables (ready to copy & paste on a bash shell
    on mpc1054.psi.ch):

`
#setup ROOT from afs/cern.ch
source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/gcc/4.6/x86_64-slc6-gcc46-opt/setup.sh
source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/app/releases/ROOT/5.34.03/x86_64-slc6-gcc46-opt/root/bin/thisroot.sh
alias root='root -l'
#setup boost c++ libraries
#change the following line if needed
#so that it points to your installation of Boost
export BOOST_HOME=/home/specuser/boost_install
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$(BOOST_HOME)/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(BOOST_HOME)/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=$(BOOST_HOME)/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
`


Run
----------------------
run the programme by supplying a FILE or FOLDER name on the command line

./bin/ccdfli_viewer FILE/FOLDER

if you specify a FOLDER name, it will continuously update the display with
    the most recent image in the folder.


Post-processing and other bonus programmes
----------------------

1) Make PNG, ROOT and GIF files
reads all images in a folder and convert them from RAW to PNG
also saves a gif animation with all the png images and a ROOT file saving
the same images as TH2D

python python/make_gif.py FOLDER

2) Changes of intensity with time
see intensity changes across all the images in a folder (e.g. a scan) in 
a region of interest

./bin/intensity_scan ~/afsproject/raw_data/2013/ccdfli/2013.02.22/S00000-00999/S00014/ --roi 250 950 524 531
