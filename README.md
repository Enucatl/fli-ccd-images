## Report Bugs & Request Features

please report any bug or feature request using the [issues webpage](https://bitbucket.org/Enucatl/readimages/issues/new).


## Download

    :::bash
    git clone https://bitbucket.org/Enucatl/readimages.git

or 

    :::bash
    git clone git@bitbucket.org:Enucatl/readimages.git

## Compile

    :::bash
    make


if the compiler cannot find the proper headers and libraries, you are
    probably missing these variables (ready to copy & paste on a bash shell
    on `mpc1054.psi.ch`):

    :::bash
    #setup ROOT from afs/cern.ch
    source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/gcc/4.6/x86_64-slc6-gcc46-opt/setup.sh
    source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/app/releases/ROOT/5.34.03/x86_64-slc6-gcc46-opt/root/bin/thisroot.sh
    alias root='root -l'
    #setup boost c++ libraries
    #change the following line if needed
    #so that it points to your installation of Boost
    export BOOST_HOME=/home/specuser/boost_install
    export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=${BOOST_HOME}/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${BOOST_HOME}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export LIBRARY_PATH=${BOOST_HOME}/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
    export PATH=~/.local/bin:$LIBRARY_PATH


## Run

run the programme by supplying a FILE or FOLDER name on the command line

    :::bash
    ./bin/ccdfli_viewer FILE/FOLDER

if you specify a FOLDER name, it will continuously update the display with
    the most recent image in the folder.


## Post-processing and other bonus programmes

The python scripts will be installed with the `python setup.py --user` option, and will end up in `~/.local/bin`. This folder should therefore be appended to the `PATH` variable.

### Make HDF5 file
reads all images in a folder and convert them from RAW to HDF5.
This file is then used in all the other scripts.

    :::bash
    make_hdf5.py FOLDER

### Analyse the raw images
Three scripts are provided to apply the same operation to each raw image:

   * `intensity_scan.py`: plot the integral in the image as a function of
      the image number.

### Analyse stacks
The easiest way to reconstruct a 2D image out of 1D lines is to stack the
lines together. More tools are then provided to analyse the stack:

   * `projection_stack.py`: make the stacked image.
   * `export_stack.py`: save the stacked image in a different format.

### Alignment tools
The stacked images can yield interesting alignment information:

   * `roll.py`: rotation about the `x` axis.
   * `pitch.py`: rotation about the `y` axis.

### Differential phase contrast
The differential phase contrast images can be calculated from phase stepping
scans:

   * `dpc_radiography.py`: reconstruct the absorption, differential phase,
      and visibility reduction images.
   * `phase_drift.py`: show the drift of the phase values during a scan.
   * `visibility_map.py`: draw a graph with the visibility as a function of
      the pixel in the detector.
